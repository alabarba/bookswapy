# bookswapy

Bookswapy is a decentralized virtual library allowing free exchange of books (both physical books and ebooks) between privates. 
The project has started in the context of my master thesis at the University of Palermo (Italy).

Bookswapy should support creation of a unique universal virtual library made by aggregating the books' collections of each user joining the community. 
Users can then freely exchange books between them while recording each lending/exchange in a blockchain ledger. 

Bookswapy should also support an optional double escrow mechanism to manage any potential dispute (for example in case the book gets lost/damaged) automatically assigning escrows to an arbitrator who will then re distribute the funds after offline negotiation.

The project is currently under development and makes use of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with chaincodes created using Convector.
